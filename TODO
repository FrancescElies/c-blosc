--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been using
https://github.com/bilke/cmake-modules/blob/master/CodeCoverage.cmake
successfully.

Just followed the guidelines: added the files to my CMAKE_MODULE_PATH directory,
added

set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/CMakeModules)
if(CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCXX)
    include(CodeCoverage)
    setup_target_for_coverage(${PROJECT_NAME}_coverage ${PROJECT_TEST_NAME}
coverage)
endif()

in my CMakeLists.txt. I also added manually gcov as a dependency for my target:

if(CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCXX)
    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_TEST_NAME} gcov)
endif()

With this, I just type

make my_project_coverage

and I get the html report in the coverage directory of my build tree.
